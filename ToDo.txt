for the tool:
add sec_soc stuff
add more connectors
add more clausing
add pronouns
add prepositions

Generate 200,000 test data points.

To Generalize:

should be able to pass in a grammar and a set of atomics from a file and generate the complex/complete/compound structures.

def atomic := A word type.  E.g. noun, verb, adjective, etc.

def bridge term := A connecting word.  E.g. and/or, if,then,because,however, etc.

Form of grammar:  

Basic clause: set of atomics.  E.g. Subject verb object.

Compound statement:

Starting atomic middle atomics and/or bridge term and final atomic.
E.g. Subject verb object and subject verb object.

Complex statement:

Starting clause connector ending clause.
E.g. Subject verb object if object boolean.

Complete statement:

All clauses needed and the frequency of a given pattern.
E.g. Compound 55% of the time,
     Complex 35% of the time,
     Simple 10% of the time.  

This should generate the code and store it in a file of the authors choosing.
Append this to the setup script.
Then this should recompile the setup and install the app.
Finally should test the app.

Remember to include the code generator code.
